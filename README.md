## Module-Description
The Cisco Puppet module for UCSM allows administrators to automate all aspects of Cisco UCS management including server, network, storage and hypervisor management. The bulk of the Cisco UCSM Puppet module workon the UCS Managerâ€™s Management Information Tree (MIT), performing create, modify or delete actions on the Managed Objects (MO) in the tree. 
The resources and capabilities provided by this Puppet Module will grow with contributions from Cisco, Puppet Labs and the open source community.

##### Dependencies

The ucsm module has a dependency on the ucsmsdk python library. See the Setup section that follows for more information on ucsmsdk.

##### Contributing

Contributions to the ciscopuppet module are welcome. See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.

## Setup
###### Puppet Master

To install git use the following command :
   ``` 
   yum install git -y
   ```
The ucsm module must be cloned on the Puppet Master server. We recommend cloning in the modules directory.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CiscoUcs/puppet-ucsm ucsm
   ``` 
  
To install pip package installer use the following commands.
   - ``` curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py ```
   - ``` python get-pip.py  ```
After pip is installed successfully install the ucsmsdk package using the following command.
   - ```pip install ucsmsdk  ```
   
   


Software version Dependencies
   - Puppet 4.x
   - Python 2.7.x
